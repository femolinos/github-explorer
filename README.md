## Introduction

Github Explorer is an application developed with the purpose of looking for Github repositories of any user in an easy and fast way. You can simply type the username you want to look up, and the application will list all the user's repositories. Also, you can check the repositorie's details, such as stars, forks and issues, and visit the repository on Github as well.

## Techs used

For this project, I used the following technologies:

- [React](https://reactjs.org);
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org);
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org);
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com);

## Run the project

To run the project succesfully, first you have to clone it to your local machine. After that, use a terminal to navigate to the folder where you cloned the repository, then run the following command:

```bash
yarn
# or
npm install
```

to install the dependencies. After that, you need to start the development server, using the following command:

```bash
yarn dev
# or
npm run dev
```

It's recommended that you use Yarn instead of NPM, since the project was developed using Yarn as package manager.
